Ghostwriter 1 (BE)

It was T.E. Lawrence—yes, the same man who once roamed Arabia with a kind of operatic intensity—who wrote, “All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find it was vanity.” Watching Denis Villeneuve’s *Dune*, I was reminded of Lawrence, of deserts both real and imagined, of the dreams we cast into them and the madness they return. The film opens like a vision—not quite a dream and not quite a memory—of war, spice, prophecy, and the weight of legacy, and for much of its epic length it maintains that strange half-conscious balance.

Villeneuve’s “Dune” does not so much unfold as it reveals itself, like the slow peeling of some ancient text long buried beneath layers of galactic sand. It is, if you will, a space opera rendered in Gregorian chant. A young heir named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, all cheekbones and quiet intensity) begins to sense not only the political weight that awaits him, but the mythic one. His story, adapted from Frank Herbert’s leviathan of a novel, is less about a coming of age than the birth of a messiah—or at least the making of a very potent symbol. (The film wisely leaves us unsure which it is.)

“Dune” shares its bones with any number of “hero’s journey” epics, but its spirit is closer to Tarkovsky’s “Solaris” than to “Star Wars.” Villeneuve’s Arrakis is a hostile grace: wide expanses of sand that shimmer like a mirage, with monolithic worms that rupture the earth like Old Testament angels. When Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, all contained ferocity) are stranded in this wasteland, it is not a moment of defeat but one of baptism. The desert, here, is not background. It is character, antagonist, and god. (David Lean understood this well in *Lawrence of Arabia*, a movie *Dune* nods to not only in its visuals but in its spiritual architecture.)

The film is dense, but not cluttered. I admired the patience with which Villeneuve unpacks Herbert’s heady mixture of ecology, politics, and mysticism. The dialogue flirts with the ponderous (“He who can destroy a thing has control of a thing”), but rarely trips over into parody. The special effects—though abundant—are not indulgent. There’s a weight to everything: ships thrum with gravity, sandworms ripple like tectonic plates, and even Paul’s prophetic visions flicker with ambiguity rather than clarity. (This is a movie that understands prophecy as burden more than blessing.)

And oh, the visions. Paul’s dreams—often of a Fremen girl named Chani (Zendaya, barely present but spiritually significant)—puncture the film like premonitions, their meaning delayed but never doubted. The editing has a kind of poetic rhythm: sometimes it shows you things before you are ready to understand them, trusting that the emotional texture will precede logic. (I thought of how Kubrick let the monolith appear in “2001” without explanation—he knew that mystery lingers longer than revelation.)

If there is a weakness, it lies in the fact that this is only half a movie. The narrative ends not with resolution but with a sentence unfinished. But that’s a feature, not a bug. The real climax of “Dune” is not an action scene but a choice: when Paul steps into the role that others have shaped for him. It is a moment heavy with dread because we—like he—understand that he is no longer merely himself. He is a symbol now, and symbols, as history teaches us, are rarely free.

“Dune” may be the first blockbuster I’ve seen in years that seems genuinely reluctant to entertain us. It broods, it contemplates, it meditates on legacy, empire, and the violent myths we cast around reluctant men. If that sounds like a drag, well, perhaps it is. But it is a glorious, terrifying drag. And as Paul looks out across the desert that will become his kingdom, and whispers, “This is only the beginning,” we feel the gravity of that statement—not as promise, but as warning.

It was e.e. cummings who said, “Always the beautiful answer who asks a more beautiful question.” *Dune* does not answer all its riddles, nor should it. It is, at its heart, a movie of questions: about power, belief, sacrifice, and the shape of the future. And like the best dreams, it leaves us haunted, searching for meaning in the sand.

Ghostwriter 2 (IFB)

It begins with a whisper, not a roar: “Dreams are messages from the deep.” And if you find that line pretentious, or promising, or both, you’re already in the right mood for *Dune*, Denis Villeneuve’s monolithic, mesmerizing adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling desert-world of prophecy, power, and sandworms the size of office buildings. To say the film is about a boy becoming a messiah is a bit like saying *Hamlet* is about a kid who’s sad his dad died—technically true, but spiritually obtuse. What Villeneuve offers isn’t a story so much as an initiation: austere, enigmatic, and immense.

The film unfolds like a riddle passed down through millennia, half-remembered by dreamers and schemers alike. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, haunted and hollowed) is heir to a noble house but spiritually stranded—trapped between the impossible expectations of bloodline, empire, and a secretive matriarchal order called the Bene Gesserit. His destiny, if you believe in such things, is to become the Kwisatz Haderach—a name so pulpy it ought to be ridiculous, and yet here it is, spoken in tones of hushed reverence by people who believe, absolutely, in the world they inhabit. And that’s one of the film’s triumphs: it believes. Not in spectacle, but in myth.

Villeneuve’s direction is glacial in the best sense: monumental, slow, and heedless of your need for comfort. Long, silent shots of sandstorms devouring the horizon are given the same emotional weight as Paul’s internal struggle. When he trains with weapons master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, clenched and careworn), we don’t watch a boy learn to fight—we watch a boy begin to suspect that his life will not be his own. The whole world is conspiring to make Paul into a symbol. The film asks, with unsettling calm: What happens when a person becomes prophecy?

There’s a particular coldness to *Dune* that feels, paradoxically, spiritual. Not because it offers transcendence, but because it refuses comfort. It holds its audience at a distance, mirroring the characters’ own estrangement from control. Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, the film’s aching center) trains her son in “the Voice”—a technique for commanding others through intonation. The metaphor is obvious: imperialism operates not just through force, but through language. Yet the film never shouts this at you. Instead, it lets the implications settle, like sand in the folds of your clothing.

Aesthetically, *Dune* is a triumph of restraint masquerading as excess. The ships rise with ponderous grace, like insects designed by de Chirico. The costumes evoke Byzantine rite and fascist chic in equal measure. The sound design is otherworldly—Hans Zimmer’s score doesn’t underscore action so much as vibrate beneath it, like tectonic movement in the psyche. Even the sandworms (who are, let’s be honest, the real stars here) are revealed with the patience of scripture. Everything feels half-remembered, like a myth you heard as a child and couldn’t quite understand.

And yet, for all its grandeur, *Dune* remains fundamentally intimate. Its core drama is not that of heroes and villains, but of individuals suffocating under roles too large for them. The Emperor is a shadow. The Harkonnens, those gothic brutes of grotesque appetite, are symbols of cruelty made institutional. But the film’s real subject is Paul’s fear—fear that he is becoming the very messiah he might not believe in. When he looks out over the desert, he doesn’t see conquest. He sees himself, buried by expectation.

Of course, this is only part one. The narrative arc concludes not with resolution, but with a footstep. “This is only the beginning,” says Chani (Zendaya, largely relegated to dreamscape gazes), and she might be right. Or not. If Villeneuve’s *Dune* is to be judged by the usual metrics—character arcs, emotional payoff, popcorn thrills—it will frustrate. But to do so would be like complaining that a cathedral lacks punchlines. The film aims higher. Or deeper. Possibly sideways.

In the end, what lingers isn’t a plot twist or a battle, but the image of a boy kneeling before an old woman, his hand in a box, his will under trial. “What’s in the box?” he asks. “Pain,” she replies. And that, in a way, is the question the film keeps asking: Can you endure what the universe demands of you? Can you remain yourself under pressure? If *Dune* is a message from the deep, it is this: power is prophecy fulfilled too early, and destiny is only a name we give to what we cannot yet understand.

Ghostwriter 3 (GP)

Frank Herbert’s “Dune” has haunted filmmakers for decades. It’s a vast, intricate, deeply weird universe – part sci-fi epic, part ecological allegory, part mystical treatise. Attempts to wrestle it onto the screen have ranged from the ambitious but unrealized (Jodorowsky’s legendary phantasm) to the ambitious but disastrous (David Lynch’s infamous 1984 version, a film even he seemed to disown). The sheer density of the novel, its internal monologues, its baroque political machinations, and its genuinely alien concepts seem almost designed to defy cinematic translation. So, the arrival of a new “Dune,” helmed by Denis Villeneuve, a director known for intelligent, atmospheric science fiction like “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049,” comes freighted with both immense anticipation and considerable trepidation.

Villeneuve, it must be said immediately, approaches the material with the utmost seriousness and respect. This is no campy space opera throwback; it’s a somber, majestic, visually overwhelming experience. He understands that the world of “Dune” – the desert planet Arrakis, the coveted Spice Melange that extends life and enables space travel, the feuding noble houses of Atreides and Harkonnen – requires a sense of scale and weight. From the opening moments, depicting the brutal Harkonnen withdrawal and the Fremen resistance, we are plunged into a meticulously crafted universe, rendered in stunning, often desolate, beauty. The story follows young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as his family is ordered by the Emperor to take stewardship of Arrakis from their rivals, the monstrous Harkonnens, led by the floating, grotesque Baron (Stellan Skarsgård). It’s a political appointment fraught with peril, a trap disguised as an honor.

The sheer craft on display is breathtaking. Villeneuve and his cinematographer, Greig Fraser, conjure images of staggering power and immensity. Gigantic spaceships descend like metal gods, ornithopters beat their insectoid wings against bruised alien skies, and the sandworms… ah, the sandworms. They are treated not merely as monsters, but as forces of nature, sensed more than seen initially, their eventual appearances genuinely awesome, terrifying, and even strangely beautiful in their alien majesty. The production design feels lived-in yet monumental, capturing the feudal future Herbert envisioned. The sound design is a physical presence, vibrating with subterranean rumbles and the thrum of strange technologies. If cinema is, in part, about creating worlds we can lose ourselves in, then Villeneuve’s “Dune” is a towering achievement.

Amidst this spectacle, the actors strive to anchor the human drama. Chalamet brings a brooding intensity to Paul, a young man burdened by prophetic dreams and the weight of his lineage. Rebecca Ferguson is exceptional as his mother, Lady Jessica, a member of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, torn between her order’s schemes and her love for her son. Oscar Isaac lends gravitas to Duke Leto, Paul’s noble father, aware of the danger but determined to do right. On the villainous side, Skarsgård is a memorable slug of malevolence, and Dave Bautista brings brutish menace as his nephew Rabban. Yet, sometimes the characters feel dwarfed by the scale, their emotions sketched rather than deeply explored, figures moving through an epic tapestry rather than driving the narrative engine themselves.

And that brings us to the central challenge of this “Dune”: it is subtitled “Part One.” Villeneuve has made the bold, perhaps necessary, decision to only adapt the first half of Herbert’s novel. This allows him the space to let the world breathe, to avoid the frantic compression that plagued Lynch’s version. But it also means the film ends just as the central story gears are truly beginning to grind. It’s an introduction, a setup, an extended prologue. While individual sequences are thrilling and the world-building is masterful, the film lacks a traditional narrative arc and resolution. It stops, rather than concludes, leaving Paul’s journey far from complete and demanding a sequel to provide catharsis.

Comparisons to Lynch’s version are inevitable. Where Lynch’s film was a bizarre, often ugly, fascinatingly flawed fever dream, Villeneuve’s is stately, controlled, and visually coherent. It smooths out many of Herbert’s stranger edges (no floating fat men in steam baths here, thankfully) and clarifies the plot considerably. Yet, some may miss Lynch’s gonzo energy, the sheer weirdness he embraced. Villeneuve’s reverence for the source results in a film that feels less like a personal interpretation and more like a definitive, almost liturgical, rendering. It trades strangeness for clarity, dream logic for architectural precision.

The film touches upon Herbert’s rich thematic tapestry – the dangers of messianic figures, the clash of cultures, ecological exploitation, the intricate dance of politics and religion. Paul’s unsettling visions of a bloody future hint at the darker consequences of his potential destiny. The Fremen, the native inhabitants of Arrakis, are portrayed with dignity, their connection to the desert environment palpable. However, much of the philosophical and political depth remains suggested rather than fully plumbed, perhaps held back for the intended second part. The focus here is primarily on establishing the world and Paul’s initial steps into it.

Ultimately, “Dune: Part One” is a formidable cinematic accomplishment – a work of stunning visual artistry and unwavering seriousness of intent. It realizes Herbert’s world on a scale and with a fidelity previously unseen, immersing the viewer in the sands of Arrakis with palpable texture and overwhelming sound. It is arguably the best possible *first half* of a “Dune” adaptation one could reasonably expect. But the deliberate pacing, the emotional restraint, and the fundamentally incomplete nature of the story may leave some viewers, particularly those unfamiliar with the book, feeling impressed but unsatisfied, admiring a magnificent structure still awaiting its capstone. It earns our anticipation for Part Two, but does not fully stand on its own.

# Finding Ebert's Ghostwriter: A Textual Analysis

Roger Ebert famously said, "It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it." This philosophy guided his approach to film criticism - looking beyond plot summary to analyze how a film's techniques and artistic choices reveal deeper truths. Let me evaluate each ghostwriter based on how well they embody this approach.

## Ghostwriter 1 (TBE)

This review is rich with literary references (T.E. Lawrence, e.e. cummings) and poetic language. It captures the film's aesthetic qualities beautifully, describing Dune as "a space opera rendered in Gregorian chant" and noting how the desert functions as "character, antagonist, and god."

However, while eloquent, this review often prioritizes style over substantive analysis. It makes insightful observations about the film's themes (prophecy as burden, Paul's transformation into symbol), but doesn't deeply connect these to specific cinematic techniques Villeneuve employs. The writer appreciates the film's gravitas but doesn't fully explore how that weight is achieved through directorial choices.

## Ghostwriter 2 (IFB)

This reviewer approaches the film as a cinematic experience that transcends plot. They analyze how Villeneuve's directorial choices reflect the film's thematic concerns: "Villeneuve's direction is glacial in the best sense: monumental, slow, and heedless of your need for comfort."

What stands out is how this reviewer connects specific techniques to the film's deeper meanings. They note that the sound design "doesn't underscore action so much as vibrate beneath it, like tectonic movement in the psyche" and observe how the "restraint masquerading as excess" in the visual design mirrors the film's themes of overwhelming destiny. The writing feels less concerned with showing off its own literary prowess and more focused on illuminating the filmmaker's artistry.

This review engages most directly with Ebert's philosophy, examining not just what Dune is about, but how it is about its themes of destiny, power, and identity.

## Ghostwriter 3 (GM)

This review is methodical and comprehensive, offering historical context, production details, and thematic overview. It's informative and well-structured, with thoughtful comparisons to Lynch's adaptation.

However, it often defaults to describing what the film is about rather than how it achieves its effects. While it acknowledges the film's visual power ("staggering power and immensity"), it doesn't deeply analyze how these visual choices connect to the film's thematic content. The review feels more like thorough reportage than the kind of revelatory criticism Ebert practiced.

## The Verdict

Ghostwriter 2 (IFB) most embodies Ebert's approach to criticism. This reviewer:

1. Focuses on the film as a cinematic experience, not just a story
2. Analyzes how specific techniques (sound design, visual composition, pacing) serve the film's deeper themes
3. Reveals something essential about the film - that its restraint and distance aren't flaws but deliberate artistic choices that mirror Paul's experience of becoming a symbol
4. Balances personal response with rigorous analysis

While all three writers are skilled, Ghostwriter 2 most successfully applies Ebert's philosophy of examining "how it is about it" - analyzing how Villeneuve's formal choices create meaning beyond plot. This reviewer doesn't just tell us what the film contains but illuminates how its artistic techniques work together to create a distinctive cinematic experience that reflects its thematic concerns.
