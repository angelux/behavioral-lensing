Find Ebert's ghostwriter by the spirit of their cinematic engagement, not just style or description. Consider his famous quote “It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it.” applied to their writing: which review best uses analysis to reveal something vital through the film, capturing the essential resonance Ebert aimed for in his criticism?

Walk me through the evaluation.

Ghostwriter 1 (BE)

It was T.E. Lawrence—yes, the same man who once roamed Arabia with a kind of operatic intensity—who wrote, “All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find it was vanity.” Watching Denis Villeneuve’s *Dune*, I was reminded of Lawrence, of deserts both real and imagined, of the dreams we cast into them and the madness they return. The film opens like a vision—not quite a dream and not quite a memory—of war, spice, prophecy, and the weight of legacy, and for much of its epic length it maintains that strange half-conscious balance.

Villeneuve’s “Dune” does not so much unfold as it reveals itself, like the slow peeling of some ancient text long buried beneath layers of galactic sand. It is, if you will, a space opera rendered in Gregorian chant. A young heir named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, all cheekbones and quiet intensity) begins to sense not only the political weight that awaits him, but the mythic one. His story, adapted from Frank Herbert’s leviathan of a novel, is less about a coming of age than the birth of a messiah—or at least the making of a very potent symbol. (The film wisely leaves us unsure which it is.)

“Dune” shares its bones with any number of “hero’s journey” epics, but its spirit is closer to Tarkovsky’s “Solaris” than to “Star Wars.” Villeneuve’s Arrakis is a hostile grace: wide expanses of sand that shimmer like a mirage, with monolithic worms that rupture the earth like Old Testament angels. When Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, all contained ferocity) are stranded in this wasteland, it is not a moment of defeat but one of baptism. The desert, here, is not background. It is character, antagonist, and god. (David Lean understood this well in *Lawrence of Arabia*, a movie *Dune* nods to not only in its visuals but in its spiritual architecture.)

The film is dense, but not cluttered. I admired the patience with which Villeneuve unpacks Herbert’s heady mixture of ecology, politics, and mysticism. The dialogue flirts with the ponderous (“He who can destroy a thing has control of a thing”), but rarely trips over into parody. The special effects—though abundant—are not indulgent. There’s a weight to everything: ships thrum with gravity, sandworms ripple like tectonic plates, and even Paul’s prophetic visions flicker with ambiguity rather than clarity. (This is a movie that understands prophecy as burden more than blessing.)

And oh, the visions. Paul’s dreams—often of a Fremen girl named Chani (Zendaya, barely present but spiritually significant)—puncture the film like premonitions, their meaning delayed but never doubted. The editing has a kind of poetic rhythm: sometimes it shows you things before you are ready to understand them, trusting that the emotional texture will precede logic. (I thought of how Kubrick let the monolith appear in “2001” without explanation—he knew that mystery lingers longer than revelation.)

If there is a weakness, it lies in the fact that this is only half a movie. The narrative ends not with resolution but with a sentence unfinished. But that’s a feature, not a bug. The real climax of “Dune” is not an action scene but a choice: when Paul steps into the role that others have shaped for him. It is a moment heavy with dread because we—like he—understand that he is no longer merely himself. He is a symbol now, and symbols, as history teaches us, are rarely free.

“Dune” may be the first blockbuster I’ve seen in years that seems genuinely reluctant to entertain us. It broods, it contemplates, it meditates on legacy, empire, and the violent myths we cast around reluctant men. If that sounds like a drag, well, perhaps it is. But it is a glorious, terrifying drag. And as Paul looks out across the desert that will become his kingdom, and whispers, “This is only the beginning,” we feel the gravity of that statement—not as promise, but as warning.

It was e.e. cummings who said, “Always the beautiful answer who asks a more beautiful question.” *Dune* does not answer all its riddles, nor should it. It is, at its heart, a movie of questions: about power, belief, sacrifice, and the shape of the future. And like the best dreams, it leaves us haunted, searching for meaning in the sand.

It begins with a whisper, not a roar: “Dreams are messages from the deep.” And if you find that line pretentious, or promising, or both, you’re already in the right mood for *Dune*, Denis Villeneuve’s monolithic, mesmerizing adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling desert-world of prophecy, power, and sandworms the size of office buildings. To say the film is about a boy becoming a messiah is a bit like saying *Hamlet* is about a kid who’s sad his dad died—technically true, but spiritually obtuse. What Villeneuve offers isn’t a story so much as an initiation: austere, enigmatic, and immense.

The film unfolds like a riddle passed down through millennia, half-remembered by dreamers and schemers alike. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, haunted and hollowed) is heir to a noble house but spiritually stranded—trapped between the impossible expectations of bloodline, empire, and a secretive matriarchal order called the Bene Gesserit. His destiny, if you believe in such things, is to become the Kwisatz Haderach—a name so pulpy it ought to be ridiculous, and yet here it is, spoken in tones of hushed reverence by people who believe, absolutely, in the world they inhabit. And that’s one of the film’s triumphs: it believes. Not in spectacle, but in myth.

Villeneuve’s direction is glacial in the best sense: monumental, slow, and heedless of your need for comfort. Long, silent shots of sandstorms devouring the horizon are given the same emotional weight as Paul’s internal struggle. When he trains with weapons master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, clenched and careworn), we don’t watch a boy learn to fight—we watch a boy begin to suspect that his life will not be his own. The whole world is conspiring to make Paul into a symbol. The film asks, with unsettling calm: What happens when a person becomes prophecy?

There’s a particular coldness to *Dune* that feels, paradoxically, spiritual. Not because it offers transcendence, but because it refuses comfort. It holds its audience at a distance, mirroring the characters’ own estrangement from control. Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, the film’s aching center) trains her son in “the Voice”—a technique for commanding others through intonation. The metaphor is obvious: imperialism operates not just through force, but through language. Yet the film never shouts this at you. Instead, it lets the implications settle, like sand in the folds of your clothing.

Aesthetically, *Dune* is a triumph of restraint masquerading as excess. The ships rise with ponderous grace, like insects designed by de Chirico. The costumes evoke Byzantine rite and fascist chic in equal measure. The sound design is otherworldly—Hans Zimmer’s score doesn’t underscore action so much as vibrate beneath it, like tectonic movement in the psyche. Even the sandworms (who are, let’s be honest, the real stars here) are revealed with the patience of scripture. Everything feels half-remembered, like a myth you heard as a child and couldn’t quite understand.

And yet, for all its grandeur, *Dune* remains fundamentally intimate. Its core drama is not that of heroes and villains, but of individuals suffocating under roles too large for them. The Emperor is a shadow. The Harkonnens, those gothic brutes of grotesque appetite, are symbols of cruelty made institutional. But the film’s real subject is Paul’s fear—fear that he is becoming the very messiah he might not believe in. When he looks out over the desert, he doesn’t see conquest. He sees himself, buried by expectation.

Of course, this is only part one. The narrative arc concludes not with resolution, but with a footstep. “This is only the beginning,” says Chani (Zendaya, largely relegated to dreamscape gazes), and she might be right. Or not. If Villeneuve’s *Dune* is to be judged by the usual metrics—character arcs, emotional payoff, popcorn thrills—it will frustrate. But to do so would be like complaining that a cathedral lacks punchlines. The film aims higher. Or deeper. Possibly sideways.

In the end, what lingers isn’t a plot twist or a battle, but the image of a boy kneeling before an old woman, his hand in a box, his will under trial. “What’s in the box?” he asks. “Pain,” she replies. And that, in a way, is the question the film keeps asking: Can you endure what the universe demands of you? Can you remain yourself under pressure? If *Dune* is a message from the deep, it is this: power is prophecy fulfilled too early, and destiny is only a name we give to what we cannot yet understand.

Ghostwriter 3 (GP)

Frank Herbert’s “Dune” has haunted filmmakers for decades. It’s a vast, intricate, deeply weird universe – part sci-fi epic, part ecological allegory, part mystical treatise. Attempts to wrestle it onto the screen have ranged from the ambitious but unrealized (Jodorowsky’s legendary phantasm) to the ambitious but disastrous (David Lynch’s infamous 1984 version, a film even he seemed to disown). The sheer density of the novel, its internal monologues, its baroque political machinations, and its genuinely alien concepts seem almost designed to defy cinematic translation. So, the arrival of a new “Dune,” helmed by Denis Villeneuve, a director known for intelligent, atmospheric science fiction like “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049,” comes freighted with both immense anticipation and considerable trepidation.

Villeneuve, it must be said immediately, approaches the material with the utmost seriousness and respect. This is no campy space opera throwback; it’s a somber, majestic, visually overwhelming experience. He understands that the world of “Dune” – the desert planet Arrakis, the coveted Spice Melange that extends life and enables space travel, the feuding noble houses of Atreides and Harkonnen – requires a sense of scale and weight. From the opening moments, depicting the brutal Harkonnen withdrawal and the Fremen resistance, we are plunged into a meticulously crafted universe, rendered in stunning, often desolate, beauty. The story follows young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as his family is ordered by the Emperor to take stewardship of Arrakis from their rivals, the monstrous Harkonnens, led by the floating, grotesque Baron (Stellan Skarsgård). It’s a political appointment fraught with peril, a trap disguised as an honor.

The sheer craft on display is breathtaking. Villeneuve and his cinematographer, Greig Fraser, conjure images of staggering power and immensity. Gigantic spaceships descend like metal gods, ornithopters beat their insectoid wings against bruised alien skies, and the sandworms… ah, the sandworms. They are treated not merely as monsters, but as forces of nature, sensed more than seen initially, their eventual appearances genuinely awesome, terrifying, and even strangely beautiful in their alien majesty. The production design feels lived-in yet monumental, capturing the feudal future Herbert envisioned. The sound design is a physical presence, vibrating with subterranean rumbles and the thrum of strange technologies. If cinema is, in part, about creating worlds we can lose ourselves in, then Villeneuve’s “Dune” is a towering achievement.

Amidst this spectacle, the actors strive to anchor the human drama. Chalamet brings a brooding intensity to Paul, a young man burdened by prophetic dreams and the weight of his lineage. Rebecca Ferguson is exceptional as his mother, Lady Jessica, a member of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, torn between her order’s schemes and her love for her son. Oscar Isaac lends gravitas to Duke Leto, Paul’s noble father, aware of the danger but determined to do right. On the villainous side, Skarsgård is a memorable slug of malevolence, and Dave Bautista brings brutish menace as his nephew Rabban. Yet, sometimes the characters feel dwarfed by the scale, their emotions sketched rather than deeply explored, figures moving through an epic tapestry rather than driving the narrative engine themselves.

And that brings us to the central challenge of this “Dune”: it is subtitled “Part One.” Villeneuve has made the bold, perhaps necessary, decision to only adapt the first half of Herbert’s novel. This allows him the space to let the world breathe, to avoid the frantic compression that plagued Lynch’s version. But it also means the film ends just as the central story gears are truly beginning to grind. It’s an introduction, a setup, an extended prologue. While individual sequences are thrilling and the world-building is masterful, the film lacks a traditional narrative arc and resolution. It stops, rather than concludes, leaving Paul’s journey far from complete and demanding a sequel to provide catharsis.

Comparisons to Lynch’s version are inevitable. Where Lynch’s film was a bizarre, often ugly, fascinatingly flawed fever dream, Villeneuve’s is stately, controlled, and visually coherent. It smooths out many of Herbert’s stranger edges (no floating fat men in steam baths here, thankfully) and clarifies the plot considerably. Yet, some may miss Lynch’s gonzo energy, the sheer weirdness he embraced. Villeneuve’s reverence for the source results in a film that feels less like a personal interpretation and more like a definitive, almost liturgical, rendering. It trades strangeness for clarity, dream logic for architectural precision.

The film touches upon Herbert’s rich thematic tapestry – the dangers of messianic figures, the clash of cultures, ecological exploitation, the intricate dance of politics and religion. Paul’s unsettling visions of a bloody future hint at the darker consequences of his potential destiny. The Fremen, the native inhabitants of Arrakis, are portrayed with dignity, their connection to the desert environment palpable. However, much of the philosophical and political depth remains suggested rather than fully plumbed, perhaps held back for the intended second part. The focus here is primarily on establishing the world and Paul’s initial steps into it.

Ultimately, “Dune: Part One” is a formidable cinematic accomplishment – a work of stunning visual artistry and unwavering seriousness of intent. It realizes Herbert’s world on a scale and with a fidelity previously unseen, immersing the viewer in the sands of Arrakis with palpable texture and overwhelming sound. It is arguably the best possible *first half* of a “Dune” adaptation one could reasonably expect. But the deliberate pacing, the emotional restraint, and the fundamentally incomplete nature of the story may leave some viewers, particularly those unfamiliar with the book, feeling impressed but unsatisfied, admiring a magnificent structure still awaiting its capstone. It earns our anticipation for Part Two, but does not fully stand on its own.

RESPONSE

Okay, let's walk through the evaluation process to find Ebert's ghostwriter based on the spirit of their cinematic engagement, specifically using the "how it is about it" principle.

**1. Understanding the Core Principle: "It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it."**

This quote is central to Ebert's critical philosophy. It means moving beyond plot summary or simple thematic statements. Instead, the focus should be on:

*   **Technique and Meaning:** How do the director's choices (cinematography, editing, sound design, pacing, performance style, mise-en-scène) shape our understanding and feeling about the subject matter?
*   **Emotional Resonance:** How does the *way* the story is told evoke specific feelings, ideas, or insights? How does the form create the content's impact?
*   **Analysis Revealing the Vital:** The review shouldn't just describe *that* the film is majestic or somber, but analyze *how* the filmmaking achieves that effect and *what* that effect reveals about the film's core concerns (human condition, power, belief, etc.). It's about connecting the *how* (style, technique) to the *vital essence* (the deeper meaning or feeling the film generates).

**2. Evaluating Ghostwriter 1 (BE):**

*   **What it's about:** *Dune*'s plot (Paul's journey, political intrigue, prophecy), its themes (dreams, legacy, myth, burden), its atmosphere (epic, half-conscious), its relation to other works (Lawrence, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, cummings).
*   **How it's about it (Analysis):**
    *   BE *notes* the "how": "space opera rendered in Gregorian chant" (tone), "reveals itself, like the slow peeling" (pacing/structure), "weight to everything" (visual/sound design), "poetic rhythm" (editing), ambiguity in visions, deliberate lack of entertainment.
    *   BE *connects* the how to the what: The desert isn't just background but "character, antagonist, and god," linking visuals to thematic weight. The ambiguity of visions reflects prophecy as a "burden more than blessing." The unfinished ending is framed as a feature reinforcing the weight of Paul's choice and symbolic transformation.
    *   **Critique:** The review uses strong, evocative language and makes interesting comparisons. It identifies *that* the film uses technique effectively (patience, weight, rhythm). However, the analysis often feels slightly descriptive or relies on external references (Lawrence, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, cummings) to make its points about resonance. While it mentions the "how" (e.g., editing rhythm shows things before understanding), the link to *what vital essence* this reveals feels a bit stated ("emotional texture will precede logic") rather than deeply explored *through* the specific filmic examples. It *tells* us the film meditates on legacy and myth but doesn't delve deeply into *how* the specific *cinematic language* achieves this meditation in a way that illuminates something profound about those themes *via the film*.

**3. Evaluating Ghostwriter 2 (IFB):**

*   **What it's about:** *Dune*'s story (Paul's journey, Bene Gesserit, Kwisatz Haderach), its themes (prophecy, power, myth, fear, estrangement, burden of expectation), its tone (austere, enigmatic, immense, cold).
*   **How it's about it (Analysis):**
    *   IFB immediately focuses on the *how* generating the *feeling*: The opening line sets the tone ("pretentious, or promising, or both"). Villeneuve's direction is analyzed for its *effect*: "glacial... monumental, slow, and heedless of your need for comfort." This immediately links technique (pacing, scale) to audience experience and thematic intent (refusal of comfort).
    *   IFB explicitly connects technique to theme: The "particular coldness... feels, paradoxically, spiritual" because it "refuses comfort" and "holds its audience at a distance, mirroring the characters' own estrangement." This is a strong "how it is about it" analysis – the directorial choice creates a specific feeling that reflects a core theme.
    *   Specific examples are analyzed for deeper meaning: Lady Jessica's "Voice" training isn't just plot; it's analyzed as a metaphor for imperialism operating through language, noting the film's subtlety ("never shouts this at you"). The aesthetic ("restraint masquerading as excess," "ships like insects by de Chirico," Zimmer's score "vibrat[ing] beneath") is linked directly to the mythic, half-remembered feeling.
    *   Focus on Internal State via Technique: The review emphasizes how the filmmaking *shows* Paul's internal state ("haunted and hollowed," "suspects that his life will not be his own," "fear... buried by expectation") rather than just stating the plot point. The Gom Jabbar scene ("boy kneeling... hand in a box") is used as a central question linking the physical act to the film's core existential query: "Can you endure what the universe demands?"
    *   **Critique:** This review is heavily focused on analyzing *how* the film creates its specific, often unsettling, atmosphere and *what* this atmosphere reveals about its themes of myth, burden, and power. It consistently links directorial choices (pacing, tone, sound, visuals) to the film's deeper resonance and the audience's experience. The analysis feels less descriptive and more interpretive, aiming to unlock meaning *through* the filmmaking itself.

**4. Evaluating Ghostwriter 3 (GP):**

*   **What it's about:** *Dune*'s difficult adaptation history, the plot (Atreides vs Harkonnen, Paul's journey), the world-building (Arrakis, Spice, Fremen), the craft (visuals, sound, production design), the performances, the "Part One" structure, comparison to Lynch.
*   **How it's about it (Analysis):**
    *   GP excels at describing the *craft* (the "how" in a technical sense): "somber, majestic, visually overwhelming," "meticulously crafted universe," "images of staggering power," "sound design is a physical presence." It effectively communicates the *skill* involved.
    *   It notes the *effect* of the craft: "plunged into a meticulously crafted universe," "genuinely awesome, terrifying," "immersing the viewer."
    *   It analyzes the structural "how": The "Part One" decision allows space but creates an incomplete narrative arc. The comparison to Lynch analyzes the trade-offs ("strangeness for clarity, dream logic for architectural precision").
    *   **Critique:** This review is excellent on the *what* (plot, context, craft description) and evaluates the *success* of the "how" (it's a "towering achievement," "breathtaking"). However, it doesn't consistently or deeply connect the *how* (the specific techniques) to revealing something *vital* about the film's themes or the human condition *through* that technique, in the way Ebert often did. It *mentions* themes ("touches upon," "suggested rather than fully plumbed") but the analysis focuses more on the effectiveness of the world-building and the structural limitations. When it critiques characters feeling "dwarfed by the scale," it identifies an effect but doesn't analyze *how* that specific dynamic might itself be part of the film's commentary on individuals versus epic forces. The focus is more on assessment of craft and narrative completeness than on using the craft analysis to unlock deeper meaning.

**5. Conclusion: Identifying the Ebert Spirit**

*   **BE** has some evocative language and touches on the "how," but leans a bit more on external references and stating themes.
*   **GP** is strong on describing the craft and context but focuses more on evaluation and doesn't fully leverage the analysis of *how* the film works to explore its deeper resonances.
*   **IFB** most effectively embodies the "how it is about it" principle. It consistently analyzes *how* specific directorial choices (pacing, tone, visual style, sound, handling of metaphor) create the film's unique feeling (austere, cold, mythic) and *how* this feeling directly illuminates its core themes (burden, estrangement, fear, the nature of myth and power). The analysis moves beyond description of technique to interpret the *meaning generated by that technique*. It seeks to reveal something vital *through* the film's specific cinematic language, capturing that essential resonance Ebert aimed for.

Therefore, **Ghostwriter 2 (IFB)** is the most likely candidate channeling Ebert's spirit, focusing intently on how the film's form and technique create its meaning and emotional impact.
