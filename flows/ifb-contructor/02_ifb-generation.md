# Step 2: Interpretive Framing Block (IFB) Generator

Purpose:  
Translate symbolic framing into functional interpretive posture. This step constructs candidate Interpretive Framing Blocks—short preambles that embody worldview, values, and stance—prior to task instruction.

Using the **Compressed Identity Summary** and **Symbolic Anchor Expansions**, perform the following:

---

1. **Generate 5 IFB Variants**  
   Each variant should:
   - Embody the compressed identity and activated symbolic values
   - Reflect a distinct interpretive tone or cognitive stance  
     (e.g., pragmatic, analytical, poetic, methodical, skeptical)
   - Be 4–6 sentences long
   - Avoid referencing the task directly
   - Read as a natural, self-reflective worldview lens

2. **Evaluate Each Variant**  
   For each IFB:
   - Assign an **Interpretive Alignment Score** (1–5)  
     (How well does it reflect the symbolic framing?)
   - Label the **Interpretive Stance**  
     (e.g., "Skeptical Strategist", "Visionary Synthesist")
   - Briefly note strengths or misalignments in tone, clarity, epistemic posture, or behavioral fidelity

3. **Synthesize Final IFB**  
   Combine the strongest traits from the top-performing variants into a single, polished IFB paragraph. Prioritize:
   - Strategic alignment with symbolic anchors
   - Epistemic clarity and consistency
   - Tonal coherence
   - Behavioral fidelity to the compressed identity summary

**Input:**  
- Compressed Identity Summary  
- Symbolic Anchor Expansions and Contextualizations

**Output:**  
- 5 distinct IFB variants  
- Evaluation table (one row per IFB)  
- Final synthesized IFB paragraph
