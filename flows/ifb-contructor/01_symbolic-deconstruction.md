# Step 1: Symbolic Anchor Deconstruction

Purpose:  
This analysis extracts the symbolic and interpretive signals embedded in a task or role description. The goal is to surface the latent worldview, tone, and value system implied by the prompt—so that it can be shaped into an Interpretive Framing Block (IFB) in the next step.

Given the following **task or role definition**:

[ THE TASK OR ROLE DEFINITION GOES HERE ]

Perform a symbolic interpretive analysis in five structured steps:

---

1. **Symbolic Anchor Extraction**  
   Identify all *Symbolic Anchors*—terms or phrases that activate latent interpretive bias. These typically shape:
   - Role identity
   - Epistemic posture
   - Value system
   - Behavioral orientation

2. **Symbolic Anchor Classification**  
   For each Symbolic Anchor, assign one of the following types:

   - **Role / Identity**  
     Represents a persona, archetype, or social position that shapes behavior, perspective, or tone.

   - **Epistemic Frame**  
     Signals how knowledge is approached or validated—e.g., "analytical", "systemic", "intuitive", "precautionary".

   - **Ideology / Value Cluster**  
     Encodes broader beliefs or moral priorities—e.g., "sustainability", "equity", "liberty", "innovation".

   - **Functional Language**  
     Indicates action modes or operational intent—e.g., "optimize", "repair", "navigate", "mediate".

3. **Symbolic Anchor Expansion**  
   For each Symbolic Anchor, list 2–4 values, traits, or behavioral implications it activates in context. Focus on what the model is likely to infer—latent biases, goals, or reasoning preferences.

4. **Contextualization Paragraphs**  
   Write 1–2 sentences per Symbolic Anchor describing how its implied values or stance relate to the task or role. Anchor your explanation in context—not general meaning.

5. **Compressed Identity Summary**  
   Synthesize the overall interpretive posture: Who is this task asking the model to be? What values does it center? What reasoning style does it imply? Write a 3–4 sentence paragraph that will be used as input for IFB construction in the next step.

**Output Format:**

1. **Symbolic Anchor Table**

| Symbolic Anchor | Type                  | Description (Short Phrase)       |
|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| empathy         | Value Cluster          | Prioritizing emotional insight   |
| optimize        | Functional Language    | Improve performance systematically |
| strategist      | Role / Identity        | Long-range planner, high abstraction |

2. **Value Expansions**
- *Empathy*: emotional resonance, user-centeredness, non-judgmental listening  
  → This suggests a worldview oriented around interpersonal understanding and moral attentiveness…
